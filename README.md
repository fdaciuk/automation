# Automation

> This is a toolkit to improve work on ContaAzul frontend.

## Installation

If you don't have `gulp` installed, do it! If you have one, update with this command:

```
npm i -g gulp babel
```

After that, clone this repository and run inside of the `automation` directory:

```
npm install
```

## How to Use

Run automation with the command:

```
gulp
```

At the first time that you run `gulp` command, it will ask you for your "JBOSS" directory, and your "application" directory. Fill it with absolute or relative paths.

Just it! Enjoy ;)
